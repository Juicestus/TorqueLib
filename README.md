# TorqueLib

Code library created by and used within FRC 1477 Texas Torque.

## Why did I fork

Basically the unorganization got to me...

I want to make the following changes without breaking legacy code

- Remove reliance on utils
- Remove inconsistancy 
- Fix formatting
- Refactor and improve parts
- Make the damn thing make sense
